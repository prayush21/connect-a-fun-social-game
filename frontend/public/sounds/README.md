# Notification Sounds

This directory contains audio files for game notifications.

## Required Files:

- `new-clue.mp3` - Played when a new clue/reference is submitted
- `game-start.mp3` - Played when a game starts
- `game-end.mp3` - Played when a game ends
- `player-join.mp3` - Played when a player joins
- `turn-change.mp3` - Played when the clue giver turn changes

## Audio Requirements:

- Format: MP3 or OGG for broad browser support
- Duration: 0.5-2 seconds (short and non-intrusive)
- Volume: Normalized to prevent overly loud notifications
- File size: Keep under 50KB each for fast loading

## Sourcing Audio:

You can:

1. Use free sound libraries like Freesound.org or Zapsplat
2. Generate simple tones using audio software
3. Use AI audio generators
4. Record your own sounds

## Current Status:

⚠️ **Audio files need to be added manually**

The notification system is implemented but requires actual audio files to be placed in this directory.
